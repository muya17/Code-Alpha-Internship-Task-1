The `fibonacci` function calculates the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. For `n` equal to 1, it returns 1, and for `n` less than 1, it returns 0. This sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Applications of these concepts include:
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Used in financial modeling, nature, and algorithms.
- **Recursion**: Ideal for tree traversal, backtracking algorithms, and divide-and-conquer strategies.
- **Base Cases**: Prevent infinite recursion and handle edge cases.
- **Memoization**: Improves efficiency by caching results to avoid redundant calculations.

Understanding and applying these concepts can enhance problem-solving and coding efficiency.
